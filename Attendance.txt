Project Overview: To categorize student performance level based on the Predicted Probalities.
Dataset includes Variables like student_id, date, attendance_status, age, gender, socio, ethnicity, subject,test,assignment score.

Data Modelling and Evaluation
Data Exploration and Pre-Processing, The dataset contain two variables(Incident_type and Year) whose data were missing ,more than 75% ,so drop the variable from the modelling. The main purpose is to work on clean data rather and provide recommendation to take decision.
-Tools:  AutoViz, Power BI
-Key steps: Understanding and analysing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding, scaling, outlier detection and treatment, anomaly detection, handling duplicates values, feature engineering.

Modelling
- Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, SVC, K-Neighbor Classifier,   Gaussian NB
- Process: Train test split with 80:20 approach, validating with cross fold - validation, smote technique was not required as the dataset was evenly distributed.
